/**
 * ðŸ“¦ (Box)
 *
 * ðŸ“¦ serves as the foundational building block for almost every other component.
 * We inject a number of style props from styled-system into a div allowing us to
 * quickly and easily manipulate CSS properties without writing CSS classes for
 * every definition.
 *
 * This approach also gives us easy access to our Theme which offers us the ability
 * to consistently reference spacing, fonts, colors, breakpoints, and other features
 * with less mark up.
 *
 * The ðŸ“¦ method has been popularized by major companies such as Uber and Segment,
 * and follows some of the same methodologies that can be found in Apple's Swift
 * coding language and others.
